# [IOTAPAY](https://iotapay.dev/) [DEPRECATED]

IOTAPAY is an open source project maintained primarily by Acyclic Labs in order to facilitate better payment methods for everyone for free.

## The web code has been moved to another repo due to the addition of backend to it. This repo is still open to create generic issues for the project.
